                I'm an aspiring Software Engineer with a passion for large-scale, high-impact Services.<br/> 
                Currently, I am pursuing my Undergraduate Degree in Computer Science at Stony Brook University. <br/>
                <br/>
                Some of my recent interests include Cloud Computing, Computer Vision, and Computer Graphics.<br/>
                <br/>
                Additionally, I am eager to explore new opportunities in Machine Learning and Full-Stack <br/>
                Development, as 
                one of my main goals to make a significant mark on the world of technology
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Outside of Work and Academics, I'm interested in learning random Trivia. <br/>
                I also play a lot of video games. Maybe too much. ðŸ˜‚
